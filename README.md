# CV / resume maker

You can use it, tested and freely give feedback at [thi live version](https://ese-rafa-cv-maker.netlify.app/)

A project based on The Odin Project curriculum.
The user is able to enter their information, deleted, edit.

In this early version is up to the user the order in which his information is displayed. I recommend although from newer to older in both education an experience sections.

The styles of this project are based on [Sharkri](https://github.com/Sharkri)'s solution for [this very same project](https://github.com/Sharkri/cv-application) of The Odin Project
